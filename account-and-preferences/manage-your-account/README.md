## Link multiple Accounts

If you signed up using your email to create an account, you have the option to connect it with your Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn, or GitBook account later on, provided that the email you used matches. This will simplify the login process for you in the future.

To link accounts, select the account you want to connect on the main log-in page.

Your computer will automatically detect that the email you have previously used is associated with another account and merge the two. This will enable you to log in using the new method, rather than having to enter your email address and password every time you log in.

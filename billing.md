# Billing

## How frequently am I billed?

You can choose 1 out of 2 options: monthly or yearly billing.

If you choose to go yearly, you will be charged a smaller fee when compared to a full year of usage under a monthly billing.

Check out our [Pricing ](https://www.uniscale.com/pricing)page for more details.



## Where can I access my invoices?

To access your Invoices, go to the Administration Settings inside your Workspace.&#x20;

Go to "Invoices" and download your invoice by clicking the icon on the right-hand side of the invoice.

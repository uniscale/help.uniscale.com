# ðŸ“ª How to get started with a module

## What are the building blocks of a module?

Modules are structured using Pages, Sections, and Functional use cases. Pages and Sections are the structural elements that you will use to make sure that you structure your application in the same way as the product. In that way, it will be easier to navigate your way around within a module in relation to the product.

In addition to the structure of your product, you will also use Functional use cases to define the user behavior within the module.

## Cater for your audience

As this is the functional requirement for your solution it is important that all your stakeholders can feel at home in the specification. This ensures optimal communication and alignment. To achieve this it is important that you define the right information within the right elements.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Use Pages and Sections for high-level explanations while using Functional use cases for more detailed explanations. In this way when filtering out Functional use cases you have a high-level point of alignment for all stakeholders.
{% endhint %}

Within Pages and Sections, you can describe high-level specifications of your functionality. In this way, all stakeholders can use this part of the specification to make sure that everyone has a high-level alignment of the functionality and the intentions that led to its current state.

## Break your specification down into pages and sections

{% hint style="info" %}
To get started, type "/" or click the "..."  menu to create content within your specification.
{% endhint %}

An easy way of getting started with your module specification is to use user interface mocks as an entry point. Let's say that we paste a mock screenshot right into our module specification.

It is then easy to use the information in the mock to break down our module specification into Pages and Sections. When we get deeper into the mocks we can start defining Functional use cases. You can read more about those in the next article.

## Summary

Modules consist of Pages and Sections to define the overall and structural build-up. They are used to communicate high-level functionality for all stakeholders. The details about the user interaction are described in Functional use cases. Read more about those in the next article.

  Functional use cases are used to specify the user interaction within your
  module. Let's look at how to use them to lock down the requirements right
  away.

# ðŸ“ª How and when to define functional use cases

## Structure vs behaviour

As explained in the previous guide Pages and sections are used to represent the structure and high level description of your specification. The Functional use cases are there for you to define the high level and in detail end user behaviour in your system. This is where you can go into detail on expected details down to contents of dropdowns, what happens when the user clicks a button or describing even cross page behaviour.

It is also helpful to look at Functional use cases as a level of detail. When someone reads the specification without showing Functional use cases they should be left with a high level overview of the solution for any stakeholder to align on. When then displaying the Functional use cases without UX flows and Designer notes the reader should be left with a high level over view of the solutions end user behaviour for stakeholders to align on. When displaying UX flows and designer notes the reader should be left with an in detail understanding of how the functionality should behave when the user interacts with it. Even one level deeper is to display the Service flows which describes the technical flow needed to implement the described functionality.

## What does a Functional use case consist of?

At the top level a functional use case consists of a description where you can describe the high level functionality provided towards the end user. The intentions for defining it may be that you need to explain a flow that the user can go through like searching for something. It could also be that you need to describe some data being loaded into the user interface or some UI design guidelines for a user interface.

### UX product notes and UX flows

The UX product notes is where you can go into more detail regarding the user experience part of the use case if required. This can also be left blank if you have no additional information to add. Under the UX product notes you can also add one or more UX flows. These are used both to describe details of the flow with acceptance criteria's and&#x20;

# Join a Workspace

Once a Workspace is created, you can join it and start working. To do this, the owner or administrator of the Workspace needs to send you an invitation.

{% endhint %}

Once invited, you will receive an email with instructions to proceed. Below you can see the steps depending on whether you already have a Uniscale account or not.



## Inviting a new account

Here is how the email looks if you do not already have an account. This email will guide you to create an account. You can also learn more here: [create-an-account.md](../../account-and-preferences/create-an-account.md "mention")

# Invite to a workspace

Follow these steps to make sure your colleagues can also access your workspace:

## Invite to a workspace

* From the sidebar of your workspace dashboard, find the "**Settings**" icon
* Navigate to the **Members tab** (visible only for admins & workspace owners)
* Add the new user e-mail, role, type of access and click "Send invitation"

Once the users receive their invite, it will be in their email inbox and also in their dashboard if they already have an account.&#x20;

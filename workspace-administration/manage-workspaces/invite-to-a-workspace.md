# Invite to a workspace

Follow these steps to make sure your colleagues can also access your workspace:

## Invite to a workspace

* From the sidebar of your workspace dashboard, find the "**Settings**" icon
* Navigate to the **Users tab** (visible only for admins & workspace owners)

* an overview of your available users usage
* quick link to upgrade your plan if you need more users
* action to invite more users

Do you need to upgrade your license to add more users?&#x20;

Please check this article on ["Plans and Subscriptions"](../../manage-billing-payments-and-plans/plans-and-subscriptions.md) or our [website ](https://www.uniscale.com/)for more information.

You can then invite users by providing&#x20;

* an email to send an invite to
* their role in the workspace
* the account type they will have in the workspace once they accept the invite
  * only **admin** & **user** types are available.



Once the users receive their invite, it will be in their email inbox and also in their dashboard if they already have an account. For a full overview of accepting invites, [see here](invite-to-a-workspace.md).

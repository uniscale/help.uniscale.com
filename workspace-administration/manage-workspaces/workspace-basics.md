# Workspace basics

## Workspace access and product access

In Uniscale, a workspace can have multiple solutions. You can customize the permission level for each user in the workspace and their access to each solution.

Get an overview below&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Workspace _owners_, _admins_, and _users_ require a subscription seat. Clients, however, do not require a seat and the amount of clients may be limited based on your subscription plan. \

## Workspace account access

In a workspace, users can have the following account access:

<table><thead><tr><th width="173">Account access</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Owner</td><td>Access to everything in the workspace</td></tr><tr><td>Admin</td><td>Can manage workspace settings and see all solutions</td></tr><tr><td>User</td><td>Will only have access to individual products.</td></tr><tr><td>Client</td><td>Can only have viewer access to products. <br>This type does not count towards subscription seats.</td></tr></tbody></table>



## Product access levels

You can customize the permission levels for each solution or service.

<table><thead><tr><th width="169">Product access</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Admin</td><td>Can invite others to, has edit and delete rights.</td></tr><tr><td>Editor</td><td>Has edit and limited delete rights.</td></tr><tr><td>Viewer</td><td>Can only view and not edit.</td></tr><tr><td>Client</td><td><p>Can only view and not edit.</p><p>Does not need to be invited to the workspace but only to individual products.

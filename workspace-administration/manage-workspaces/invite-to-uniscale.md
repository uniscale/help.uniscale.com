# Invite to Uniscale

## Workspace access and solution access

In Uniscale, a workspace can have multiple solutions. You can customize the permission level for each user in the workspace and their access to each solution.

To learn about permission levels: [workspace-basics.md](workspace-basics.md "mention")

{% hint style="info" %}
If you invite someone to a workspace and want them to access a specific solution, you will also need to invite them to that solution separately: [#invite-to-a-solution](invite-to-uniscale.md#invite-to-a-solution "mention")
{% endhint %}



## Invite to a workspace

* From the sidebar of your workspace dashboard, find the "**Settings**" icon
* Navigate to the **Members tab** (visible only for admins and workspace owners)
* Add the new user e-mail, role, and type of access and click "Send invitation"

{% hint style="info" %}
Do you need to upgrade your license to add more users?&#x20;

Please check this article on ["Plans and Subscriptions"](../../manage-billing-payments-and-plans/plans-and-subscriptions.md) or our [website ](https://www.uniscale.com/)for more information.
{% endhint %}



Once the users receive their invite, it will be in their email inbox and also in their dashboard if they already have an account.&#x20;

### Email verification

The _invitee_ can join the workspace by accepting the email invitation sent to them - see an example below.&#x20;

## Invite to a solution

When sharing a product (solution or standalone service), the invited user or the current user will gain access to it. Their ability to read or write specification content for that solution will depend on the permissions assigned to them. See the [workspace-basics.md](workspace-basics.md "mention") for more information on the different types of access.

You can share a product by using one of the below methods:

1. From the **product overview;**
2. From the **editor**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="1. Sharing from the product overview" %}
When sharing a solution from the workspace dashboard, the invitee will have access to the workspace as well.

1. Press the button "**Share**" and invite users to the solution
2. You can invite:
   * **Existing users** in the workspace by their email
   * **OR** type in the email address of a **new user** you would like to invite to your solution
3. Choose their access level in the dropdown menu.
   * Read more on [#product-access-levels](workspace-basics.md#product-access-levels "mention")
4. You can then click ‚Äú**Add**‚Äù and the invitee will receive their invitation via email.
5. You have now successfully shared a solution! üéâ

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="2. Sharing from the editor" %}
When sharing a product in the editor you are sharing the solution as a whole. You are also sharing the workspace as well, with the account type of **`user`**(by default). Read more about [#workspace-account-types](workspace-basics.md#workspace-account-types "mention")

**Press "Share" on the button on the right side of the topbar**

1. You can share a solution, module, or lower elements in the solution. The permission(s) will be at the same solution level.
2. Type in the email address of the person you would like to invite to your solution
3. Choose their access level in the dropdown menu.
   * Read more on the differences: [#product-access-levels](workspace-basics.md#product-access-levels "mention")
4. You can then click ‚Äú**Add**‚Äù and the invitee will receive their invitation via email.
5. You have now successfully shared a solution! üéâ

# Workspace details and Contact Information

### What is the workspace details section?

The Workspace details contain information related to your Workspace and update any important fields such as Workspace name, Workspace ID, Company Size and Workspace Icon.

### What is the contact information section?

The Contact Information section is a page with generic information on your company and contact person for matters related to your Workspace such as Company e-mail and website, Country of origin and contact details of the contact person(s).



### How to update these sections?

Go to the Administration settings on your Workspace - you can access it directly from your personal dashboard by clicking the cogwheel next to the Workspace's name.

Inside the Administration settings, select "General".

You can now update both fields and save any changes made.

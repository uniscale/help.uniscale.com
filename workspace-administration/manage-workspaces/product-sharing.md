# Product sharing

When sharing a product (solution or standalone service), the invitee or the current user will have access to your product. They will be able to read or write specification content for that solution (depending on the given user access). Or you might as the product owner or admin need to edit the access levels.&#x20;

## Sharing a product&#x20;

There are **2 methods:**&#x20;

1. From the **product overview**&#x20;
2. From the **editor**

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="1. Sharing from the product overview" %}
When sharing a solution from the workspace dashboard, the invitee will have access to the workspace as well.

* You can invite:&#x20;
  * &#x20;**Existing users** in the workspace by their email
  * **OR** type in the email address of a **new user** you would like to invite to your solution&#x20;
* Choose their access level in the dropdown menu.&#x20;
  * Read more on the differences : [#product-access-levels](workspace-basics.md#product-access-levels "mention")
* You can then click “**Add**” and the invitee will receive their invitation via email. &#x20;
* You have now successfully shared a solution! :tada:&#x20;
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="2. Sharing from the editor" %}
When sharing a product in the editor you are sharing the solution as a whole. You are also sharing the workspace as well, with the account type of **`user`**(by default). Read more about [#workspace-account-types](workspace-basics.md#workspace-account-types "mention")

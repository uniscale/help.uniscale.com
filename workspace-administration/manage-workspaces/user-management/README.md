### Role

The roles will help you get an overview of what role the user has within your organization. This does not impact their permission level within the Uniscale workspace.



## Access level management

In Uniscale, a workspace can have multiple solutions. You can customize the permission level for each user in the workspace and their access to each solution.

Get an overview below&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Workspace _owners_, _admins_, and _users_ require a subscription seat. Clients, however, do not require a seat and the amount of clients may be limited based on your subscription plan. \
\
Learn how to invite: [invite-to-uniscale.md](../../invite-to-uniscale.md "mention")
{% endhint %}



### Workspace account access

In a workspace, users can have the following account access:

<table><thead><tr><th width="173">Account access</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Owner</td><td>Access to everything in the workspace</td></tr><tr><td>Admin</td><td>Can manage workspace settings and see all solutions</td></tr><tr><td>User</td><td>Will only have access to individual products.</td></tr><tr><td>Client</td><td>Can only have viewer access to products. <br>This type does not count towards subscription seats.</td></tr></tbody></table>



### Product access levels

You can customize the permission levels for each solution or service.

<table><thead><tr><th width="169">Product access</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Admin</td><td>Can invite others to, has edit and delete rights.</td></tr><tr><td>Editor</td><td>Has edit and limited delete rights.</td></tr><tr><td>Viewer</td><td>Can only view and not edit.</td></tr><tr><td>Client</td><td><p>Can only view and not edit.</p><p>Does not need to be invited to the workspace but only to individual products. Does not count towards subscription seats.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>





## Editing product access level <a href="#editing-product-access-level" id="editing-product-access-level"></a>

These permissions can be changed from a product via the product settings modal by following the steps described below:

1. Open the desired solution or service.
2. Within a product editor, click on the **`settings`** icons
3. Navigate to "**Members**"
4. Edit per user the column for the access level. To read more about the access levels: [#product-access-levels](./#product-access-levels "mention")



### Changing access level to client

Please note that if you want to change the access level to "client", you will need to ensure that this person does not already have a workspace user.&#x20;

Go to [#workspace-management](./#workspace-management "mention")to remove the user from your workspace and you will be able to invite them to the product as a client.

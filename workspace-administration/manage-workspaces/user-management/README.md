## Account types

There are three types of Account access:

* **Owner:** Every workspace can only have one owner who will have access to everything within the workspace.
* **Admin**: Can add or delete users to the Workspace as well as create Solutions and Services.
* **User:** Can only create and write Solutions and Services.

## Role

The roles will help you get an overview of what role the user has within your organization. This do not impact their permission level within the Uniscale workspace.

## Status

There are two types of status:

* **Active:** This indicates that the user has accepted the invite and have access to the workspace.
* **Invitation sent:** This indicates that the user has received the invitation email.

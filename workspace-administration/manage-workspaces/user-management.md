## Account access

There are three types of Account access:

### Owner

Every workspace can only have one owner who will have access to everything within the workspace.

### Admin

An Admin user can both add or delete users to the Workspace as well as create and write functional and technical specifications.

### User

On the other hand, someone with User access can only create and write functional or technical specifications.

## Role

The roles will help you get an overview of what role the user has within your organization. This do not impact their permission level within the Uniscale workspace.

## Status

There are two types of status:

### Active

### Invitation sent

# User management

You can access the User Management page directly from your Administration Settings inside your Workspace. From the User Management page, you can see who is part of your Workspace, what accesses they have, and roles and delete or add any users to your Workspace.

If you are the owner or admin of your Workspace, you can remove a user by going to the User Management page inside the Administration Settings of your Workspace.

When inside the User Management page, remove a given user by clicking the red icon next to the user's name.

Check to see how you can add new users to your Workspace

{% content-ref url="invite-to-a-workspace.md" %}
[invite-to-a-workspace.md](invite-to-a-workspace.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

A single user can either have Admin or User access.

An Admin user can both add or delete users to the Workspace as well as create and write functional and technical specifications.

On the other hand, someone with User access can only create and write functional or technical specifications.



### Account Roles

This section allows you to attribute roles that can match the different positions users have inside your organization.&#x20;

This will help you to maintain an overall idea of the roles you have directly working in your Workspace.

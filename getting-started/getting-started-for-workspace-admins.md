# Getting started for workspace admins

If you manage a team and are responsible for the solution your team aims to build, you will most likely be the owner and admin of the Workspace created in Uniscale.

As one of your first steps, you will need to create the Workspace to be used by your team, select the right plan, and invite your colleagues to join.



## Create a Uniscale workspace

{% content-ref url="../workspace-administration/manage-workspaces/create-a-workspace.md" %}
[create-a-workspace.md](../workspace-administration/manage-workspaces/create-a-workspace.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}



## Invite your team to join your Workspace

{% content-ref url="../workspace-administration/manage-workspaces/invite-to-a-workspace.md" %}
[invite-to-a-workspace.md](../workspace-administration/manage-workspaces/invite-to-a-workspace.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

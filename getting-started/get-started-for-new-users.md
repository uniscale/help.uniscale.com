# Get started for new users

## Join a workspace

If you have been invited to join a workspace in Uniscale, follow the three steps  below:



### Step 1: Check your e-mail

Look for an email invitation from Uniscale sent by the workspace admin. If you cannot find it, check your spam or junk folder.



### Step 2: Create a Uniscale account

Follow the instructions to create your Uniscale account. You can sign up using single sign-on (SSO) or via e-mail.

If you already have a Uniscale account, skip this step and jump to step 3.

{% endcontent-ref %}



### Step 3: Accept the invitation to join a workspace

Once your Uniscale is created, you will be ready to start working in a specific workspace. Click on the invitation link provided in the email and log in to Uniscale.

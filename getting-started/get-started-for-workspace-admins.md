# Get started for workspace admins

If you are tasked with managing a team and overseeing the solution your team is building, you will likely serve as the owner and admin of the Workspace created in Uniscale. Here's a comprehensive guide to help you kickstart your journey:



### Step 1: Create a Uniscale workspace

Click on the "Create new" workspace button highlighted in blue and follow the prompts to set up your workspace according to your team's needs.

{% content-ref url="../workspace-administration/manage-workspaces/create-a-workspace.md" %}
[create-a-workspace.md](../workspace-administration/manage-workspaces/create-a-workspace.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}



### Step 2: Invite your team to join the workspace

Send invitations to your colleagues, enabling them to join and collaborate within your Workspace.

{% content-ref url="../workspace-administration/manage-workspaces/invite-to-a-workspace.md" %}
[invite-to-a-workspace.md](../workspace-administration/manage-workspaces/invite-to-a-workspace.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}



### Step 3: Configure user permissions

Customize your workspace permissions, users, and contact information.

{% content-ref url="../workspace-administration/manage-workspaces/user-management.md" %}
[user-management.md](../workspace-administration/manage-workspaces/user-management.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

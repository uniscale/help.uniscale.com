See our [Create a Workspace](quick-start-guide.md#create-workspace) article for more details on how to create a workspace.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}



## Design your solution

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Create solution" %}
Within your workspace, create a solution to describe your product and outline the functional specifications.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Define functional specifications" %}
Clearly outline what your project needs and how it should work, providing a roadmap for development available to all stakeholders.&#x20;

Check the [Specification Basics](../using-uniscale/specification/solution-basics.md#module) article for more details on how to write your functional specifications

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Linking your services" %}
This is where you start to document your services.&#x20;

Within the UX flows in your Solution, the process of linking your services begins by selecting "Service Flow."&#x20;

From here, navigate to the Service Linking Tab, where you can establish connections between your UX flows (integral components of your Solution) and newly developed services, thereby initiating your service journey.

Check out our [Service Linking article](https://help.uniscale.com/using-uniscale/documentation/service-linking) for detailed guidance on how to link services.

_Tip: Consider inviting a technical expert, such as a Lead Developer or Software Architect, to guide you as you develop your services._
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}



## Document your services

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Document your services" %}
By breaking down your specifications, you can now document your services based on functional needs.&#x20;

This will give you a clear overview of what is needed from the services and enable you to quickly iterate on future versions.

{% endtabs %}

## Generate and implement your SDK

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Generate SDK" %}
After finishing your specification and documentation, generate the initial version of your SDK for developers to use in backend and frontend development.

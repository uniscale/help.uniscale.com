# How to get started with a module

## What is the building blocks of a module?

Modules are structured using Pages, Sections and Functional use cases. Pages and Sections are the structural elements that you will use to make sure that you structure your application in the same way as the product. In that way it will be easier to navigate your way within a module in relation to the product.

In addition to the structure of your product you will also use Functional use cases to define the user behaviour within the module. These functional use cases describes the high level user behaviour in its description while it breaks down the details of it through its UX flows (user experience flows). In this way the reader can choose to read the specification through the preferred level of detail. Even designer notes have their own sections within Functional use cases to explain details around look and feel.

The connection between the service documentation and the module specification happens through the UX flows in Functional use cases. Through them you can link to service flows which is a services way of expressing intent of usage to some of it's endpoints.

As the specifications over time grows large it is important to structure it right so that it is easy focus in on only parts of the specification. It is therefore important that you make yourself some thoughts around locating the parts of the specification that is meant to be read together in the same location.



## Cater to your audience

As this is the functional requirements for your solution it is important that all your stakeholders can feel at home in the specification. This ensures optimal communication and alignment. To achieve this it is important that you define the right information within the right elements.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Use Pages and Sections for high level explanations while using Functional use cases for more detailed explanations. In this way when filtering out Functional use cases you have a high level point of view for aligning all stakeholders.
{% endhint %}

Within Pages and sections you can describe high level specifications of your functionality. In this way all stakeholders can use this part of the specification to make sure that everyone has a high level alignment of the functionality and the intentions that led to its current state. From there the reader can enable Functional use cases or even UX flows and designer notes to dig into the details needed to implement the requirements.



## An easy way to specification breakdown

{% hint style="info" %}
Type / or click the ... menu to start creating content within your specification.
{% endhint %}

An easy way of getting started with your module specification is to use user interface mocks as an entry point. Let's say that we paste a mock / screenshot / drawing right into our module specification.

## Specifying your first module revision

Let's dive in an specify up the first revision of a module. We will go through the elements used to write it and some decisions behind why and how.

## Summary

Modules consists of Pages and sections to define the overall and structural build-up. They are used to communicate the high level functionality for all stakeholders. The details about the user interaction is described in Functional use cases. Read more about those in the next article.

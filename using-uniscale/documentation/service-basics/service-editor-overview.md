# Service editor overview

## Interface breakdown

Once inside the service editor, you will be presented with the following view:

Breaking it down, we can identify 3 main elements which will be your helping items in navigating, orienting and defining your service.

### Overview

Here, as your service grows, you will see a hierarchical representation of your service. Very similar to what most IDEs have but in this case with the elements of a service.&#x20;

The list can be filtered or searched via the top inputs.

The structure will grow in size as your service develops as well.

### Main content

The center of your work. Here is where your documentation will take place and be modeled. In time, your documentation will grow significantly in size and complexity, so for that, the editor allows for multiple filtering options and viewing modes.

### Predefined views

<figure><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (41).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

On a high level, the content will show all its elements in your documentation. Further from that, you can browse into specific views, which contain the following elements

Depending on which view you are on, different elements will appear. As such various filters for those items' **completion** or **lockable** state will be shown.

For the most relevant statuses within a revision, the interface shows a badge indicating the number of items that match that filter ( Draft & opened and Edited & Unlocked).

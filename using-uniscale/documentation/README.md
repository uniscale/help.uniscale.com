# Documentation

## Introduction

Specification is the second of three phases in the [uniscale-method.md](../../getting-started/uniscale-method.md "mention").This is where you begin to model your services and outline the needed requirements to specify the technical functionality of your solution.

## Start describing your documentation

* Before describing your documentation, check our article for an overview of the elements and functionalities: [service-basics](service-basics/ "mention")
* The next step is to link your specifications to your services:[service-linking](service-linking/ "mention")
* When ready, lock and approve your services: [service-revisions.md](service-revisions.md "mention")

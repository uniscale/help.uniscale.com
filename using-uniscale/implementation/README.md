# Implementation

## **Introduction**

Automatically generate technical documentation and SDKs that align perfectly with your functional product specifications, saving time and reducing errors.

## SDK library

Here you will automatically generate and have access to an SDK library with a set of code snippets based on the documentation you have defined for your solution and services.

<table><thead><tr><th width="130"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>What</td><td>Collection of tools, code samples, and documentation that will be used by developers to build your solution.</td></tr><tr><td>Why</td><td>Allows for a decoupled backend and frontend and helps your developers to write better code.</td></tr><tr><td>Who</td><td>Software Developer</td></tr><tr><td>Outcome</td><td>Fully generated SDK library in the language of your choice.</td></tr><tr><td>How</td><td><a data-mention href="introduction-to-sdk/#generating-the-sdk">#generating-the-sdk</a></td></tr></tbody></table>



## Implementation

Here, you will write and implement your code in the Code Editor, utilizing our IDE plugin to enhance your coding efficiency and quality.

<table><thead><tr><th width="131"></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>What</td><td>Involves writing and integrating code based on the specified functional and technical requirements defined inside Uniscale.</td></tr><tr><td>Why</td><td>Provides a seamless coding experience due to the IDE plugin.</td></tr><tr><td>Who</td><td>Software Developer</td></tr><tr><td>Outcome</td><td>Implement the required code to build your solution according to the functional and technical specifications within Uniscale.</td></tr><tr><td>How</td><td><a data-mention href="library-implementation-basics/">library-implementation-basics</a></td></tr></tbody></table>

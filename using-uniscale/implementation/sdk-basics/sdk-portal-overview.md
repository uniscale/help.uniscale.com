## Topbar

In a similar manner to the ones found in specification and documentation. For a more detailed breakdown, check [#topbar](../../specification/solution-basics/solution-editor-overview.md#topbar "mention")



## 1- Library setup

Quite an important section as it will allow the user to&#x20;

* Select which services to include in the specification&#x20;
* Select which languages to generate the library into.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Changes made here will trigger the library generation process, so make sure you review the changes before committing them.


{% endhint %}



## 2- Library access

Depending on which languages you have enabled in your library setup, different tabs will show up, one per language enabled. Uniscale supports currently 4 languages (.net, Python, Java, and TypeScript).

For each tab, you will find a general information section, where you can quickly access&#x20;

* the specific language library's repository URL
* the repo secret
* library name
* latest version
* and the solution ID

Up next, you will find custom per language installation guides in various steps.

The SDK history represents a timeline of your Library generation versions. They show

* the library version
* the library name
* logos per each language enable in that version

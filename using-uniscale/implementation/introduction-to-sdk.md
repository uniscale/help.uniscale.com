Getting Started with the Uniscale SDK
{% endembed %}

The output of the modeling work and approval of your modeled services and solution in Uniscale is the SDK (Software Development Kit), a library made in select programming languages for developers to realize the model into functioning source code and front-end implementations.

For solutions, the SDK serves as a single source of truth for the developers creating the software and helps everyone stay on track, relying on the same documentation and specification. By putting in work in the model you are sure to answer many questions before developers get started, which makes for a faster development cycle.‍

Services can be made in the languages most capable of delivering the functionality to the application. Developers working from the perspective of another service only need to rely on the endpoints being exposed by the service.

#### ‍‍Supported languages

We provide a choice of languages to generate your SDK. Currently, we support the following languages:

* .Net
* Java
* Python
* TypeScript‍



## **Downloading the SDK**

Uniscale hosts the generated library in a repository accessed through the common package managers for your language.

Using the credentials provided in the SDK menu you will be able to pull the library into your development project and pull any new versions from the same repository when future iterations are made.

* Maven (java)&#x20;
* Nuget (.Net)
* pip (python)

# Describe your detailed specification

{% hint style="success" %}
Before you begin to describe your detailed specification, please make sure to have completed the high-level specification: [describe-your-high-level-specification.md](describe-your-high-level-specification.md "mention")
{% endhint %}



## Introduction to detailed specification

This is where you will involve a Product Designer (eg. UX or UI designer) who will start to break down the specification and design the product. This includes:

* The best approach to solving the described problem: Should it be an app, website, software, a combination, or perhaps just a paper?
* Describing the intended user experience.
* How should the user interface look and feel?



## Describe the detailed specification

{% hint style="info" %}
To begin describing the detailed specification, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the elements in a solution. These are all explained here: [solution-basics.md](solution-basics.md "mention")
{% endhint %}

### Create visuals for your modules

If you haven't already, a good place to start is by inserting images with mockups or wireframes of your solution. Adding visuals will help get a clear overview of what needs to be broken down.



### Break down the structure of your solution

With your visuals created, you will begin to form the layout and interface of your solution.&#x20;

To break down your solution, make use of [#pages](solution-basics.md#pages "mention") and [#sections](solution-basics.md#sections "mention").&#x20;

For each element created, add a short description and an image to highlight that specific part of the solution.



### Describe the user behavior with Functional use cases

With your structure defined, it is time to describe the behavior of your solution.

{% hint style="info" %}
In the high-level specification, the purpose of the Functional use case is to describe the high-level user behavior **abstractly**. Now, you will begin to describe the **concrete** use cases for each page and section.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

1. Begin by creating Functional use cases.

2. Create a description for your Functional use case.&#x20;
3. Add [UI Designer notes](#user-content-fn-1)[^1]. This allows you to describe the look and feel in addition to other descriptions helpful to the frontend developer.
4. Add [UX Product](#user-content-fn-2)[^2] notes with [UX flows](#user-content-fn-3)[^3].&#x20;
5. Enrich your UX flows with [Functional acceptance criteria](#user-content-fn-4)[^4].

UX flows are the lowest level of detail in your functional specification. When these are ready, your specification is ready.

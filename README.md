# How to use Uniscale

## **Create an account**

Go to [app.uniscale.com](https://app.uniscale.com/) and click the sign-up link under the login form to create your new account. You can either sign up using single sign-on (SSO) or via e-mail.

{% content-ref url="account-and-preferences/create-an-account.md" %}
[create-an-account.md](account-and-preferences/create-an-account.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}



## **Create a Workspace**

After logging in you will see your Personal Dashboard, this is where you can edit your account details and either access or create workspaces.

{% content-ref url="workspace-administration/manage-workspaces/create-a-workspace.md" %}
[create-a-workspace.md](workspace-administration/manage-workspaces/create-a-workspace.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}



## **Define your functional specification**

After creating a workspace, you can **create a Solution**. This is where you will describe your product and break down your functional specification

Read more articles and guides on **Solution Editor** here:

{% content-ref url="using-uniscale/specification/" %}
[specification](using-uniscale/specification/)
{% endcontent-ref %}



## **Describe your technical documentation**

Create services to address the needs of your solution’s modules and give them use cases with features that will satisfy the UI flow requests.

‍

## **Implementation - Generate SDK**

After both services and the solution have been approved, you can generate the first version of your SDK and have both back-end and front-end developers use it with their respective languages.

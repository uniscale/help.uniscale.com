# ðŸ“Ž How to get started with a solution

## What does a solution consist of?

A solution consists of modules and services. The modules describe all your functional requirements for the end user while the services describe the requirements to the underlying technical flows that will enable you to build this functionality.

You will incrementally write parts of your specification as you deliver functionality through projects, sprints, or however you deliver functionality in your organization's process. This is achieved by making revisions of your modules and services.

Over time your solution specification will follow your product as the single source of truth for all intentions and decisions that went into making your product what it is today. This is key to being able to make good decisions in the future.

## How do I define my module and service boundaries?

The key to succeeding with your Uniscale solution design is the way you split the solution functionality into modules and services. First of all, a module is a grouping of the end user functionality in your solution that: belongs together and changes together.

{% hint style="info" %}
The boundary of a module or a service is defined by functionality that belongs together and frequently changes together, and that is owned by a single team or department in your organization. This minimizes the risk of having cross team projects which again reduces friction.
{% endhint %}

When trying to scale a software product organization it is almost impossible when multiple teams try to deliver functionality into the same modules and services. This results in parallel deliveries from multiple teams to the same functionality and always ends up in high organizational friction due to functionality conflicts and misalignments.

It is crucial that when functionality is split into modules the majority of your deliveries regard a single module and services delivered by the team or department owning that module.

{% hint style="info" %}
Split the functionality so that you end up with deliveries mostly involving a single module and services owned by the same team or department.
{% endhint %}

## Describing your first solution and creating your first module

Let's dive straight into producing some valuable content. You will have the same rich text capabilities wherever you are within the Uniscale specification and documentation.

{% hint style="info" %}
Wherever you are in the specification you can always use type / to trigger the command menu. The command menu contains all the options within the element you are located in. For instance, in the solution description, you will have the command for creating a module. You will find the same information using the ... menu in the top right corner of the element you are in.
{% endhint %}

### Describe your solution

You can start by simply just describing your solution overall in the solution description. If your plan includes the generative AI functionality you can easily get started by getting some ideas from the AI. This is very helpful for instance when wanting to get help on making your specification well articulated and readable.&#x20;

Remember that even though the AI can help you express things more clearly you are the one responsible for making sure that your intentions and requirements are communicated.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Communicating a new concept is much easier than communicating and aligning on ad-hoc changes to a concept.
{% endhint %}

### Create your first module

To get started with creating your first module you can either use the / menu or you can use the Create module button in the top solution context bar. This is also where you can go into a specific module or service. This is important when working with revisions.

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Create modules either through the / command or by using the solution context menu at the top.</p></figcaption></figure>

{% hint style="info" %}
By selecting a module in the solution context dropdown you can get to the module focus view. In there, you can approve your module revision, look at previous revisions, and more.
{% endhint %}

As with the solution, you can also write a short introduction to the module before you start structuring your specification into Pages, Sections, and Functional use cases.

## Summary

Solutions consist of modules and services where modules describe end-user functionality and services describe the technical requirements needed to deliver that functionality. It is crucial to put thought into how you split a solution into modules and services. It relates to the ownership within your organization and the ability of your organization to scale with your product.\
You can create new modules by either using the / command or creating one from the solution context menu at the top of the page.
